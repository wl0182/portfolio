## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop
- (Optional for local development) Java 17+, Maven, Node.js & npm

### Running with Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/wl0182/Restaurant-Ordering-System.git
    cd Restaurant-Ordering-System
    ```
2. **Create a `.env` file in the project root** with the following variables:
    ```env
    POSTGRES_DB=your_db_name
    POSTGRES_USER=your_db_user
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_db_password
    SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/your_db_name
    SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=your_db_user
    SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=your_db_password
    JWT_SECRET=your_very_long_secure_jwt_secret_256_bits_or_more
    ```
3. **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```
   This will pull the backend and frontend images from Docker Hub and start all services.

## User Access & Testing

### Admin Access Required

**Important:** To test the application, you need admin credentials since user registration requires a valid staff Employee ID from the database.

**Default Admin Login:**
- **Email:** `admin@example.com`
- **Password:** `Password`

### User Registration Process

1. **Staff Verification:** New users can only register if their Employee ID exists in the Staff database
2. **Role Assignment:** All new registrations receive `ROLE_USER` by default
3. **Admin Privileges:** Only `ROLE_ADMIN` users can access administrative features

### Role-Based Features

#### Regular Staff (`ROLE_USER`)
- Kitchen Dashboard - View and manage cooking queue
- Tables Dashboard - Manage table sessions and orders
- Order Management - Create and track customer orders
- Admin Dashboard - Restricted access

#### Administrators (`ROLE_ADMIN`)
