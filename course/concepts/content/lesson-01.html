        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Java is a programming language that helps you build applications by writing instructions for the computer to follow. Before you can create complex programs, you need to understand the basic building blocks that make up any Java program. Variables let you store information, data types tell you what kind of information you can store, and operators help you work with that information. Control structures like if-else statements and loops give you the power to make decisions and repeat actions. Think of these basics as learning the alphabet before writing sentences - once you master these fundamentals, you'll be able to express any idea in code. These concepts are the foundation you'll use throughout your Java journey, from simple programs to advanced web applications.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="prose prose-slate mt-8 max-w-none dark:prose-invert" id="variables">
        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>A variable is a named container that stores a value in your program's memory. Every variable in Java has a specific type that determines what kind of data it can hold. You can think of variables as labeled boxes where you put information that you want to use later in your program.</p>

        <h3>Analogy</h3>
        <p>Imagine your desk has several labeled drawers: one marked "Pens," another "Paper," and another "Calculator." Each drawer can only hold items that match its label - you wouldn't put paper in the pen drawer. Variables work the same way in programming. When you create a variable called "age," it's like labeling a drawer specifically for storing numbers that represent someone's age. You can put a number in that drawer, take it out to use it, or replace it with a different number, but you can't suddenly put text in a drawer meant for numbers. The label (variable name) helps you remember what's inside, and the type ensures you only store the right kind of information.</p>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre><code class="language-java">// Declare an integer variable to store someone's age
int age = 25;                    // Create a box labeled "age" and put 25 in it

// Declare a text variable to store someone's name
String name = "Alice";           // Create a box labeled "name" and put "Alice" in it

// Declare a decimal variable to store a price
double price = 19.99;            // Create a box labeled "price" and put 19.99 in it

// Use the variables in your program
System.out.println(name + " is " + age + " years old");  // Print: Alice is 25 years old
System.out.println("Price: $" + price);                  // Print: Price: $19.99

// Change the value in a variable
age = 26;                        // Replace 25 with 26 in the "age" box
System.out.println(name + " is now " + age);             // Print: Alice is now 26

      <section class="prose prose-slate mt-8 max-w-none dark:prose-invert" id="data-types">
        <h2>Data Types</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Data types specify what kind of information a variable can store and how much memory it needs. Java has two main categories: primitive types (like int, double, boolean) that store simple values directly, and reference types (like String) that store references to more complex objects. Understanding data types helps you choose the right container for your data.</p>

        <h3>Analogy</h3>
        <p>Think of data types like different types of containers in a kitchen. You have small spice jars for holding small amounts of seasonings (like boolean for true/false), medium containers for storing flour or sugar (like int for whole numbers), large containers for liquids like milk or juice (like double for decimal numbers), and special containers like recipe boxes that hold complete instructions (like String for text). Each container is designed for a specific purpose - you wouldn't store soup in a spice jar or try to fit a whole cookbook in a small container. Similarly, each data type in Java is optimized for storing specific kinds of information efficiently and safely.</p>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre><code class="language-java">// Primitive data types - store simple values directly
int studentCount = 30;           // Whole number (no decimals)
double temperature = 98.6;       // Decimal number (can have fractions)
boolean isOnline = true;         // True or false value only
char grade = 'A';                // Single character

// Reference type - stores reference to an object
String courseName = "Java Programming";  // Text (sequence of characters)

// Using different data types
System.out.println("Course: " + courseName);           // Text output
System.out.println("Students: " + studentCount);       // Number output
System.out.println("Temperature: " + temperature + "°F"); // Decimal output
System.out.println("Online status: " + isOnline);      // Boolean output
System.out.println("Grade: " + grade);                 // Character output

// Data types prevent mistakes
// studentCount = "thirty";     // This would cause an error - can't put text in number container
// isOnline = 42;              // This would cause an error - can't put number in true/false container

      <section class="prose prose-slate mt-8 max-w-none dark:prose-invert" id="operators">
        <h2>Operators</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Operators are symbols that perform operations on values and variables. Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) do math calculations, comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) compare values, and logical operators (&&, ||, !) work with true/false conditions. Operators are the tools that let you manipulate and work with your data.</p>

        <h3>Analogy</h3>
        <p>Think of operators like tools in a workshop. Arithmetic operators are like basic tools - a hammer (+) joins things together, a saw (-) separates them, and a measuring tape (==) checks if two things are the same size. Comparison operators are like a scale that tells you which item is heavier, lighter, or if they weigh the same. Logical operators are like decision-making tools - they help you combine multiple yes/no questions to make a final decision. Just like how you use different tools for different jobs in a workshop, you use different operators depending on what you want to do with your data. Some tools work on numbers (like addition), others work on true/false values (like logical AND), and some can work on both (like equality comparison).</p>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre><code class="language-java">// Arithmetic operators - do math calculations
int a = 10;
int b = 3;
int sum = a + b;                // Addition: 10 + 3 = 13
int difference = a - b;         // Subtraction: 10 - 3 = 7
int product = a * b;            // Multiplication: 10 * 3 = 30
int quotient = a / b;           // Division: 10 / 3 = 3 (integer division)
int remainder = a % b;          // Modulus (remainder): 10 % 3 = 1

System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);             // Prints: Sum: 13
System.out.println("Remainder: " + remainder); // Prints: Remainder: 1

// Comparison operators - compare values
boolean isEqual = (a == b);     // Check if equal: 10 == 3 is false
boolean isGreater = (a > b);    // Check if greater: 10 > 3 is true
boolean isLessEqual = (a <= b); // Check if less or equal: 10 <= 3 is false

System.out.println("10 equals 3: " + isEqual);    // Prints: 10 equals 3: false
System.out.println("10 greater than 3: " + isGreater); // Prints: 10 greater than 3: true

// Logical operators - combine true/false conditions
boolean hasLicense = true;
boolean hasInsurance = false;
boolean canDrive = hasLicense && hasInsurance;  // AND: both must be true
boolean needsEither = hasLicense || hasInsurance; // OR: at least one must be true
boolean noLicense = !hasLicense;                // NOT: opposite of hasLicense

System.out.println("Can drive: " + canDrive);     // Prints: Can drive: false
System.out.println("Has at least one: " + needsEither); // Prints: Has at least one: true

      <section class="prose prose-slate mt-8 max-w-none dark:prose-invert" id="conditionals">
        <h2>Conditionals (if/else)</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Conditionals allow your program to make decisions and execute different code based on whether certain conditions are true or false. The if statement checks a condition, and if it's true, executes one block of code; otherwise, it can execute a different block with else. This gives your programs the ability to respond differently to different situations.</p>

        <h3>Analogy</h3>
        <p>Imagine you're getting dressed in the morning and you look outside to check the weather. If it's raining, you grab an umbrella and wear a raincoat. If it's sunny, you wear sunglasses and light clothes. If it's cold, you put on a warm jacket. You're constantly making decisions based on conditions - "if this, then do that." Your brain processes these conditions automatically: IF (it's raining) THEN (take umbrella) ELSE IF (it's sunny) THEN (wear sunglasses) ELSE (wear regular clothes). Conditionals in programming work exactly the same way - they let your program look at the current situation (check a condition) and decide what action to take based on what it finds.</p>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre><code class="language-java">// Simple if-else statement
int temperature = 75;

if (temperature > 80) {                    // Check if temperature is hot
    System.out.println("It's hot! Wear shorts.");
} else if (temperature > 60) {             // Check if temperature is mild
    System.out.println("Nice weather! Wear a t-shirt.");
} else {                                   // If neither condition is true
    System.out.println("It's cold! Wear a jacket.");
}

// Multiple conditions example
int age = 17;
boolean hasPermit = true;

if (age >= 18) {                           // Check if old enough to drive alone
    System.out.println("You can drive independently.");
} else if (age >= 16 && hasPermit) {       // Check if old enough AND has permit
    System.out.println("You can drive with supervision.");
} else {                                   // If too young
    System.out.println("You need to wait to drive.");
}

// Checking multiple conditions
int score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {                         // Excellent grade
    System.out.println("Grade: A - Excellent work!");
} else if (score >= 80) {                  // Good grade
    System.out.println("Grade: B - Good job!");
} else if (score >= 70) {                  // Passing grade
    System.out.println("Grade: C - You passed!");
} else {                                   // Needs improvement
    System.out.println("Grade: F - Please study more.");
}

      <section class="prose prose-slate mt-8 max-w-none dark:prose-invert" id="loops">
        <h2>Loops</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Loops are structures that repeat a block of code multiple times. The for loop is used when you know how many times you want to repeat something, the while loop continues as long as a condition is true, and the for-each loop goes through each item in a collection. Loops save you from writing the same code over and over again.</p>

        <h3>Analogy</h3>
        <p>Think of loops like repetitive tasks you do every day. When you brush your teeth, you move the brush back and forth many times - that's like a for loop where you repeat an action a specific number of times. When you keep stirring soup until it's hot enough, you're doing a while loop - you continue the action as long as a condition is true (soup is not hot enough). When you go through your mail piece by piece, reading each letter or bill, that's like a for-each loop - you perform the same action (reading) on each item in a collection (the mail pile). Loops in programming work the same way, letting your program repeat actions efficiently without you having to write the same instructions multiple times.</p>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre><code class="language-java">// For loop - repeat a specific number of times
System.out.println("Counting to 5:");
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {            // Start at 1, continue while i <= 5, add 1 each time
    System.out.println("Count: " + i);    // Print the current number
}

// While loop - repeat as long as condition is true
int countdown = 3;
System.out.println("Rocket launch countdown:");
while (countdown > 0) {                   // Continue as long as countdown is greater than 0
    System.out.println(countdown);        // Print current countdown number
    countdown--;                          // Subtract 1 (same as countdown = countdown - 1)
}
System.out.println("Blast off!");

// For-each loop - go through each item in a collection
String[] fruits = {"apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"};  // Array of fruits
System.out.println("Fruits in our basket:");
for (String fruit : fruits) {             // For each fruit in the fruits array
    System.out.println("- " + fruit);     // Print the current fruit with a bullet point
}

// Practical example - calculating total
int[] prices = {10, 25, 15, 30};          // Array of prices
int total = 0;                            // Start with total of 0
System.out.println("Calculating total price:");
for (int price : prices) {                // For each price in the prices array
    total = total + price;                // Add current price to total
    System.out.println("Added $" + price + ", total now: $" + total);
}
System.out.println("Final total: $" + total);

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>You've now learned the fundamental building blocks of Java programming. Variables let you store and organize data, data types ensure you use the right container for each kind of information, and operators give you the tools to work with that data. Conditionals allow your programs to make smart decisions, and loops let you repeat actions efficiently without writing redundant code. These concepts work together to form the foundation of every Java program you'll ever write. As you move forward, you'll see how these basics combine to create more complex functionality, from simple calculations to sophisticated applications. Next, we'll explore how to organize your code into reusable pieces called methods.</p>
